# EER is "Enhanced Entity Relation" 

In this, there is Entity inheritance and other special features.
(This file will go over briefly:)

### SPECIALIZATION:
The act of an entity "inheriting" from a parent entity type


### Disjoint specialization
In this,
an ent of the parent class may be a member
of only one specialized subclass.


### Overlapping specialization
In this,
an ent of of the parent class may be a member
of more than one of the specialized subclasses.
