# First normal form

Requires that tables do not have tables nested inside of them.

Aka, you cannot have lists as attributes;
each row value corresponds to one value only.



This is true for SQL implicitly.
SQL does not allow you to create databases that aren't in 1NF.




in other words:
__ALL SQL DATABASES ARE ALREADY IN FIRST NORMAL FORM__
