# Converting ER diagram to database schema:

> Convert every single Entity type to it's own table 
    put attributes in entity
    set key attribute as hashtable key.

> Convert every relation type to it's own table.

> For all weak Entity types, do the same except:
    Add the weak Entity's "identifying parent"
