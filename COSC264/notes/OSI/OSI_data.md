# There are 4 Protocol Data Units (PDU)s
# on the OSI model:


## transport layer  (layer 4)
PDU is the segment or the datagram.

## Network layer    (layer 3)
PDU is the packet.

## Data link layer  (layer 2)
PDU is the frame

## Physical layer   (layer 1)
PDU is the bit





## Each layer from 1-4 has it's own header.

Intuitively, this means that headers are nested!!
