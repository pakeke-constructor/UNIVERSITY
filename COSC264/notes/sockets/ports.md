# ports

**Simply put:**
Ports are just a software abstraction from the UDP/TCP protocols.
They do not exist in the hardware.
**simply put ends**


Ports are NOT in computer hardware! They are only used as unique identifiers
in the TCP / UDP layer 4 protocols.

The reason they are used is to allow multiple different connections from the same
remote IP.

Without ports, two connections from the same remote IP would not be possible.

This is why we must have ports. They are nothing to do with the hardware,
and are actually quite high-level.
