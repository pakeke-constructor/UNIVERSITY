# Socket and address families
There are many different address and socket families.


"Socket family" is specified when the socket is created,
and will determine what address family is used.

## List of socket families:


# AF_INET  ( host, port )
host is either an IPv4 public address, or a domain name. (google.com)
port is a port on *YOUR OWN* device.

# AF_INET6  ( host, port, flowinfo, scope_id )
Used for IPv6
