# Caching

Caching is used lots to remember where DNS queries
led to.


For example, NZ ISPs will often cache the address
of the .com namespace server.

### timeouts!
HOWEVER! Sometimes the address for this stuff changes!
    *(not often tho.)

Therefore, cache entries are set to time out after
a certain amount of time.
