# IMAP
### Mail access protocol (NOT FOR SENDING)

IMAP allows multiple computers to use the same email.
When a device is out of date, the server will sync the device.

This means that emails cannot be deleted from servers;
they must stay there indefinitely.

_optimization_: IMAP will also cache emails on your own devices,
to save having to update from the server every time you check your
inbox.
