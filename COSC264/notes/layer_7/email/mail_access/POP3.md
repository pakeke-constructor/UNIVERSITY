# POP3
### Mail access protocol (NOT FOR SENDING)


*POP3 is super basic, and outdated.*

The server basically sends a client all the new emails in the inbox,
and then the server deletes them.
Those emails are then stored on someone's computer, rather than the server.

__ISSUE:__
What if you recieve an email on your phone, and then check your computer?
Too bad! The email is only sent to one device, so you won't recieve the email 
on your computer. 
(Also, the email is deleted on the server too.)

This is a bad and outdated form of Mail access.



# Advantage:
Emails can be viewed offline if they are already cached.

This cannot happen on IMAP, because the email may have been deleted,
so it would show incorrect data.
