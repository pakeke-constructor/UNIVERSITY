# Modems

A modem usually has a public IP (Usually owned by the ISP)
that connects a private network to the wider internet.



### Home owned Modems

Not all modems have public IPs, however. 
Some Modems connect your private network to another bigger
private network. 
(Note that private networks can be nested easily.)

In the case of ISP deployed Modems, the bigger network is usually
the wider internet, with the public IP address space.
