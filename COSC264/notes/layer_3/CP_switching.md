# Circuit and Packet Switching
These methods are used to determine routes across the network.
<osi.jpg:   These are level 3 on the diagram. >


**NOTE**: The programmer does not decide the route types,
the ISP decides the route types!
Generally the ISP will choose the cheapest, or most efficient.



## Packet switching
Packet switching is a "pathless" route, i.e. packets will
take the route that is cheapest or most efficient.

    (  Generally ISPs are charged on a per-data basis.  )




##  Circuit switching
Essentially creates a giant circuit in the network.
The ISP will request channels at their own discretion!

    (  Generally ISPs are charged on a per-unit time basis,
       even if no data is being sent across the channel,
       the channel is still being used.  )
