# ALOHA Protocols
(Named after a famous network in hawaii.)


The ALOHA protocols are protocols that try to minimize
the amount of collisions through a channel
===>  If a node is sent data, but is already recieving data,
      the node will have to deny the new data.
      >> *This is a data collision*.
      ALOHA gives ways to get around this.

# Pure ALOHA:
- If you have data to send, send the data

- If, while you are transmitting data, you receive any data from another station, there has been a message collision. All transmitting stations will need to try resending "later".


# Slotted ALOHA:
Same as Pure ALOHA, but transmissions can only start at given
timeslots.
