# Network interface card (NIC)


This is the same as the more colloquial "Wifi card."

Basically every NIC will recieve a MAC address from it's hardware creator,
however it *can* be changed if you really want.

NIC's are used by computers, and will usually connect to routers.
When you have an Ethernet cable, an "NIC" is what you connect to.
