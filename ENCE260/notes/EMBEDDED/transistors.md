# Transistors

(AKA MOSFETs)

Transistors are little devices that either let current through, or not.
They are the building blocks of logic gates.



# The current problem (and solution)

What happens if the data bus is not able to send enough current through
to the LEDs?

Well, instead we can send a small amount of current through that activates
an internal transistor.
The transistor can then let current through from an "internal" power source.

This way, the current required to power the LEDs does not need to be sent
through the data bus!



# N and P transistors

N-channel transistor:
    When gate is high, conducts

P-channel transistor:
    When gate is low, conducts
