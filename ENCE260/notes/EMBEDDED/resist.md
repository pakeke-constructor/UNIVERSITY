### RESISTORS


# pull up resistors:

Used to keep the current at a minimum value.
If the current falls below a certain point, it is "pulled back up".

_Why do we need a resistor for this? And HOW does it work?_
_Resistors dont output current!_
The resistors only serve to activate / deactivate the pull up mechanism;
There is also an external voltage that will drive the pull-up current

>>> Floating voltages:  <-- what pull up prevents.
A "Floating voltage" is a voltage that is determined by electromagnetic
fluctuations.
It happens when there is no current running through a circuit.

Using a pull-up resistor, we can prevent floating voltages.




# pull down resistors:

Keeps the current from rising above a certain level.
(Just a regular resistor that can be changed on / off.)



# current limiting resistor:
AKA Guard resistor
AKA "just a normal resistor"

Pretty obvious; stops current from getting too high, protects
vulnerable parts of the circuit.
