multiplexer / demultiplexer
encoder / decoder  (N to M encoder)

cpu clock

ripple counter circuit

Latch, register, flip-flop

sequential / combinatorial circuits   (I suspect this is very simple.)

Moore and Mealsy FSMs



circuit symbols
(Like, I understand what AND and OR are,
but what are the symbols?
Also what is the symbol for NOT?)
