There are a couple of types of computer architecture.

_However, the most common is "Harvard" architecture._
_The other is quite rare because its slower._


Harvard architecture:
    Seperates instruction memory and data memory.
    -> Therefore, can fetch instructions and data
        *simultaneously.*
    

Von Neumann:
    Instructions and memory are stored in the same place.
    This is slower, as you can only send one thing through
    the pipeline at once.
