__QUICK NOTE__:
Note that you can make selections that overlap over the side of the board!
As long as selections have the same value it is fine.



# Format:

   
.   \ AB 
     \__00__01__10__11___
 C 0 |  1   0    0   1
   1 |  0   1    0   1


Each value on the horizontal row
is a tuple (A,B)

The value on the vertical row is just C.


K-Maps can be any dimensions though.
