# Logic

Sequential logic:
    Relies on past state  AND  inputs.


Combinatorial logic:
    Haskellian; only cares about inputs.



## Funny logic syntax:
Let _A_ and _B_ be logic variables.

__OR__:
_A_ V _B_
_A_ + _B_  (NOTE: 1+1 = 1 IN THIS CASE; ITS LOGICAL OR.)


__AND__:
_A_ ^ _B_
_A_ _B_  (looks like multiplication)

__NOT__: is just a line overhead.


__XOR__: 
The symbol is a circle with a plus inside.
