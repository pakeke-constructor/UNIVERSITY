# CPU Buses

A "bus" is simply a memory pipeline that data is sent through.


__BUSES FOR MEMORY__

# address bus
Sends and recieves memory addresses
( Address space is 2 * bus_width )
(Both directions!)


# data bus
Sends and recieves actual data
(Both directions!)


# control bus
Specifies *when* data transfers occur
Specifies *which direction* data transfers go


__BUSES FOR IO__:
IO only needs the *data bus* and the *control bus*;
since no data is stored in the IO.
