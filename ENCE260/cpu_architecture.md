# CPU registers:
Cache memory, usually located close
to ALU's.

# ALU:  (Arithmatic Logic Unit)
{
##  can do these cmds:
* + - /
bitwise AND, OR, NOT
==, >=,  <=  >  <

    (inputs and output are CPU registers)
}




# cpu clock
Every CPU has a clock, this is to allow logic gates
enough time to process signals without race conditions
