# Non-deterministic finite state automata


These are the same as FSAs, except states
can have more or less than 1 output per symbol.

- If a state has more than one output for a symbol, 
  the NDFSA will go to either of the branches

- If a state has no output for a symbol,
  the NDFSA will stop execution.
