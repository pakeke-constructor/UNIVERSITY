# BNF NOTATION  +  syntax diagrams

BNF notation is like regex, but spaces, *, and [] () brackets are ignored.

(example: we want to represent single digit numbers in
a list, like [1,2,3,4,6,2,5] )

List = [ Numbers ]
Numbers = (digit)(, digit)*


## Syntax diagram
We can also draw a syntax diagram for this:

(Oval shape = terminal,  rectangle shape = non-terminal )
(arrows represent direction of matching.)
